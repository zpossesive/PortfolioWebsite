# Portfolio Website
A Small Portfolio Website

- Easy to switch images (just use the same name)
- For the playlist, use Spotify’s HTML Embed with a height of “25%” and width of “500px”
- The headline is the name, which you can easily change. However, for the title, you will need to modify the JavaScript command accordingly.
